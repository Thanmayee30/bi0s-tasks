CRYPTOGRAPHY:

The Numbers: In this CTF a png file is given containing the numbers and flag should be extracted from those numbers.
In the format 16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14}
As given the format of the flag should be as PICOCTF{}. So I compared with the letters and found that first thing without braces is PICOCTF.
The flag is PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}.
