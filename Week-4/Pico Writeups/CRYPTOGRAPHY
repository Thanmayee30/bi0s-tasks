The Numbers:
A .png file is provided with numbers as 16 9 3 15 3 20 6{20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14}.
I found the letters are given numbers. After encoding the given message I obtained it as "PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}".

Easy1:
The given CTF is Vigenere cipher. The encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO.  
I used the following algorithm to encode it:
  1.Find the row corresponding the the letter.
  2.In the row, find the column which contains the matching ciphertext letter.
  3.The matching plaintext letter is noted at the top of the column.
The flag is obtained as "picoCTF{CRYPTOISFUN}".

13:
Given encoded message in ROT 13 "cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}".
After decoding it we obtain "picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}".

Flags:
There is a image containing flags and the flag should be in the format of 'PICOCTF{}'.
After observing the flags and googling them I found that these flags are International Code of Signals and International maritime signal flags.
So according to the flags I decoded the encrypted message and found the flag as "PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}".
