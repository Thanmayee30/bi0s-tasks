Insp3tor:
A link is provided. I clicked on the link and then I inspected the website and I found some html files in which the flag is hidden in comments I searched the 3 files for the file.
The flag is "picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}"
Where are the robots:
I opened the link and inspected the website but I found nothing. So I started looking in a different way and I added robots.txt at the last of the link.
It displayed as follows: 
  User-agent: *
  Disallow: /8028f.html
 Now I used /8028f.html at the end of the link and it displayed the flag as "picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_8028f}".
