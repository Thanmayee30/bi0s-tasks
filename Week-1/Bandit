LEVEL-1-->LEVEL-2:
        In this level we need to check if any files are available which may contain the flag so we use "ls" command to see if any files are available it displays readme.
        To read that file we use a command "cat readme" and it displays the flag as "boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1" which is the password to the next level.
LEVEL-2-->LEVEL-3:
        In this level also we use the command "ls" and it displays - .Now to read that file we use "cat <-" command and it displays the flag as "CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9"
        which is the password to next level.
