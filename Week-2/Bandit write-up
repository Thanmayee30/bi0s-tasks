LEVEL-0:
        I loged into bandit game using SSH on port number 2220 and use the password as "bandit0". We need to find the password to next level using commands.
        "ls" command is used to list the files. 
        "cat [file]" displays the contents of the particular file.
        The password for the next level is "boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1".        
LEVEL-1:
        Again I used "ls" and "cat" commands.
        The password for the next level is "CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9"
LEVEL-2:
        In this case the password is saved in the file named "spaces in this filename".
        So to read the particular file using "cat" command. The password is displayed as "UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK"
LEVEL-3:
        In this level the "ls" command displays a directory named inhere.To move the file into the inhere directory "cd" command is used.
        As mentioned in the question that password is hidden in a file so I used a command "ls -a" to look into hidden files 
        "cat" command is again used to read the hidden file. The flag is "pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB".
LEVEL-4:
        In this again "ls" command displays a directory named inhere. There are many files in this directory so I used the command "for x in {0..9}; do file ./-file0$x;done"
        to check into evey file that contain the wanted code and I found only one file containing "ASCII text" so I used "cat" command to read that particular file.
        The flag is "koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh".
LEVEL-5:
        As mentioned in the question that the flag is in inhere directory and having properties which is human readable;1033 bytes in size and not executable 
        In inhere directory I used "find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable" and I found out the particular file and the flag is "DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7".
LEVEL-6:
        As mentioned in the question the suitable command is "find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 32c 2>/dev/null" and we get a file that suits all the conditions.
        Now use "cat" is used to get the contents of the file. The flag is "HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs"
LEVEL-7:
        "ls" command displays the file data.txt and I used the command "cat data.txt | grep millionth" for the flag. The flag is "cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV".
LEVEL-8:
        Here "sort data.txt | uniq -u" as the flag is only line of text which occurs only once. The flag displayed is "UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR".
LEVEL-9:
        After using "ls" I used "strings data.txt | grep =" as that contains the strings containing the different kind of strings and that is stored in data.txt.
        The flag is "truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk"
LEVEL-10:
        The command "cat data.txt | base64 --decode" is used as per the given data in the question .The flag is "IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR".
