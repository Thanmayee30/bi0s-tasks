LEVEL-0:
        I loged into bandit game using SSH on port number 2220 and use the password as "bandit0". We need to find the password to next level using commands.
        "ls" command is used to list the files. 
        "cat [file]" displays the contents of the particular file.
        The password for the next level is "boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1".        
LEVEL-1:
        Again I used "ls" and "cat" commands.
        The password for the next level is "CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9"
LEVEL-2:
        In this case the password is saved in the file named "spaces in this filename".
        So we read the particular file using "cat" command. The password is displayed as "UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK"
LEVEL-3:
        In this level we use the "ls" command it displays a directory named inhere. As mentioned in the question that password is hidden in a file so
